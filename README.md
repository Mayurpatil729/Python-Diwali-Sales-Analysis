# Diwali Sales Analysis - Data Analysis Python Project

## Project Overview

The **Diwali Sales Analysis** project is designed for beginners to explore and analyze sales data using Python. This project focuses on identifying key trends in sales data to enhance customer experience and improve overall sales performance. By examining customer demographics, purchase behaviors, and product preferences, the analysis helps identify potential customers and optimize sales strategies, inventory planning, and marketing efforts.

## Project Learnings

- **Data Cleaning and Manipulation**: Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilized pandas for data manipulation and analysis, and matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identified potential customer segments across various states, occupations, genders, and age groups to target specific demographics.
- **Sales Optimization**: Identified the best-selling product categories and individual products, aiding in inventory management and meeting customer demand.

## Key Insights

1. **Customer Demographics**:
   - Analysis revealed key customer segments based on gender, age, and occupation, allowing for targeted marketing strategies.
2. **State-Wise Performance**:
   - Identified top-performing states, highlighting regions with the highest sales and potential areas for marketing focus.
3. **Age and Gender Analysis**:

   - Examined sales data by age and gender to identify the most active buying groups, helping tailor promotions and offers.

4. **Product Category Performance**:
   - Discovered which product categories and specific products were most popular, guiding inventory management to focus on high-demand items.

## Project Details

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Handled missing values, corrected data types, and removed outliers to prepare the dataset for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Used **pandas** for data manipulation to calculate key metrics.
- Created visualizations using **matplotlib** and **seaborn** to explore relationships between variables and identify trends.

### 3. Customer Segmentation

- Analyzed data by different demographics (state, occupation, age, gender) to identify high-potential customer segments.
